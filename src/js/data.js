        description: <span>A storytelling game designed to introduce young audiences to fundamental concepts
        in computer science. The game eases students into these concepts through engaging examples and
        intuitive game mechanics, rather than focusing on the full extent of algorithms. 
        <br /><br /> 
        As part of a full-stack application, the game collects data on student progression, 
        which is transmitted and stored in a database for tracking and analysis. When loading the game, 
        data from the database is used to allow students to continue from where they left off, providing
        a seamless experience.
